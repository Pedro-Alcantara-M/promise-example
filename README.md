# Promise example

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of task throttling using promises in JavaScript. The project utilizes Husky for pre-commit hooks and Prettier along with ESLint for code formatting and styling.


### Usage

```http
 git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Alcantara-M/promise-example
```

2-  Navigate to the project directory:

3- Install dependencies:

 npm install
```

Run the project: 

```http
 npm run start
```

### Functionalities 

- Debug and observe request timing

```http
 npm run debug
```

- Husky is configured to enforce code formatting and styling using Prettier and ESLint before each commit. This ensures consistency and maintains code quality throughout the project.
